# Linc
LINC (Linc Is Not Centralized)


# Topology
The Network Topology is not fixed. The nodes will be part of a moving topology. 
The capacity of each node can be unique, and there will be charge-balancing algorithms 
that adapt the topology to the charge of each node.

# Algorithms needed
## Communication
- Broadcast
- Scatter
- Leader election
- Routing

## Node control
- Shutdown
- Spawn
- Display topology
- Get another node

## Data Storage
- Store Data
- Recover Data
- Release Data
- Replication
